/*
 * SPECBOOST
 * An id that increases the specificity of a CSS selector.
 * This technique can be used to override styles from a more specific selector.
 * 
 * USAGE AND CONFIGURATION
 * Use the :is() pseudo-class with the #specBoost id to increase specificity.
 * Example: :is(p, #specBoost) { ... }
 * 
 * Note: This technique should be used sparingly, as it can make your CSS more complex and harder to maintain.
 * Always try to increase specificity through proper structuring of your CSS and HTML first.
