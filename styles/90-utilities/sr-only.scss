/*
 * VISUALLY HIDDEN / SCREEN READER ONLY
 * A utility that hides an element visually but keeps it accessible to
 * assistive technologies like screen readers.
 * Info: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html
 *
 * Also includes styles for the [hidden] attribute to completely hide
 * elements from view.
 *
 * A mixin was implemented to allow inclusion within media queries and
 * other nested rules, avoiding duplication and specificity issues.
