/*
 * FILE: viewport.scss
 *
 * This file defines viewport widths for fluid type, spacing scales, and 
 * breakpoints for responsive design.
 *
 * The `items` map includes:
 *  - Viewport size name (e.g., "min", "mid", "lrg", "max")
 *  - Corresponding value in rem for each viewport size
 *
 * The `min` and `max` values are imperative for generating fluid type and 
 * spacing scales. The `mid` and `lrg` values are used to set responsive 
 * breakpoints.
 *
 * All values are defined in rem. If one wishes to define values in px, the 
 * adjustment should be made in the `processClamp` function in the 
 * `10-functions/process-clamp.scss` file.
 *
 * Additionally, the unit would need to be changed in the `media-query` mixin 
 * located in the `20-mixins/media-query.scss` file.
