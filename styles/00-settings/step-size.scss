/*
 * FILE: step-size.scss
 *
 * This file defines the step sizes used in the project with min and max values 
 * for responsive scaling. These steps are used to calculate the actual font sizes.
 *
 * The `items` map includes:
 *  - Step size name (e.g., "-2", "0", "5")
 *  - Corresponding min and max values for responsive scaling
 *
 * All values are defined in pixels. The conversion to `px` or `rem` is handled 
 * by the `processClamp` function in the `10-functions/process-clamp.scss` file.
 *
 * For each step, a min and max value are defined, and the size adjusts based on 
 * the viewport width.
 *
 * The following settings are defined in the `process-clamp.scss` file:
 *  - `unit-type`: Defines the unit type for the step sizes (e.g., "px", "rem").
 *  - `relative-unit-type`: Defines the relative unit type for viewport-based 
 *    scaling (e.g., "vw", "vi").
